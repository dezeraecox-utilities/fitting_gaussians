# Fitting Gaussians

An example repository for simulating and fitting data composed of any number of gaussian distributions, with optional noise. 

Included examples are shown in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder, where this code has been adapted/used for various teaching applications.

- Creating example [plots for chromatography](https://github.com/dezeraecox-utilities/fitting_gaussians/blob/master/notebooks/chromatography.pdf
- Calculating [area under curve](https://github.com/dezeraecox-utilities/fitting_gaussians/blob/master/notebooks/integration_example_NM.pdf) using generic integration vs fitted params (gauss amplitude)
